_Perverse Academic Incentives_. Government agencies risk $200 billion in R&D per year. Start-ups [emerging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal) from this R&D draw in almost dollar-for-dollar venture capital investments. Most technological advancements scale-up the most promising of these efforts into peace-time, war-time, and money-time products and implements. But if we turn to **infrastructure**: no one's funding you to build infrastructure. NIH doesn’t give R01s for epistemic elegance. They want data, statistical significance, and a manuscript in NEJM. But MyST shines not in raw data—it excels at narrative explanation, cross-domain integration, reproducibility, and transparency. Until reproducibility gets financial incentives, MyST & `.ipynb` won’t have institutional traction.
